# Military Intelligence Research - Critical Findings
Armed Forces research revealed that individuals with IQ below 83 couldn't be trained productively affecting approximately 10% of population.


50-year investigation that 10% of the population cannot be utilized in any productive manner whatsoever for
34:12
military enterprises. And so it doesn't take much thought about that to understand that something approximating
34:19
the same thing applies in the general world. Which means that the conservative
34:25
idea that everyone can get ahead merely as a consequence of diligent effort and
34:30
the liberal idea that everyone can be trained to do anything given enough
34:35
resources are both seriously wrong and nobody knows what to do about that. So
34:42
now the psychometricians also outlined the basic structure of personality
34:48
considered from a statistical perspective generating the now well-known so-called big five models.
34:56


# The Big Five Personality Model - Core Traints Structure
Extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness. Honesty, humility is sometimes
added to that as is the dark tetrad which is a constellation of malevolent

# High in Trade Openness - Neural Creativity - Idea Networks - Creative thinking involves neural systems activating associated ideas, with varying levels of connection strength between concepts.

are surrounded by other neural systems which contain or represent associated
ideas. Okay? and that there's some probability that when you hear a given idea or encounter a given idea that
associated ideas will be simultaneously activated.

Some people are an inexhaustible well of new ideas which as I said can degenerate
1:02:52
into something approximating mania. Some people
1:02:57
stick with what they've heard and that's it. You can actually assess something like this quite straightforwardly. So
1:03:02
for example, I could get all of you to spend three minutes writing down all the
1:03:08
words you can think of that are four letters long and begin with the letter S. And what we'd find is that first of
1:03:14
all there's a parto distribution of your production. Some of you will produce 90 words at the exceptional exceptionally
1:03:23
fluent people among you and some of you will produce five and far more of you
1:03:28
perhaps not five 10 far more of you will produce the lower numbers than the higher numbers. That's an inerdicable
1:03:36
law of creative production. A small minority of the people do all the creative work. It's actually the square
1:03:42
root of the number of people who are involved in the enterprise do half the work. That's that's Price's law, right?
1:03:50
A brutal another brutal psychometric/economic finding.
1:03:56
How many words you produce in 3 minutes is a decent predictor of your lifetime creativity. So especially in combination
1:04:04
with general cognitive ability or intelligence. Intelligence is probably something like the rate at which you can
1:04:10
produce ideas. Whereas creativity is something like the breadth of idiational
1:04:15
scope and the probability that relatively distant ideas will be
1:04:20
co-activated. So you know someone particularly creative makes a big leap. So imagine there's an idea there's a
1:04:27
core of close concepts around it. There's a secondary penumbra of more distal ideas. Outside of that, more
1:04:34
distal ideas. Yet more creative people have more ideas in general but also leap
1:04:39
farther out which can make them wrong because they jump to the wrong conclusion and also difficult to
1:04:46
understand be because they're so creative and also make it hard for them to explain how they got there because
1:04:52
that process occurs to them as something like a revelation rather than as the consequence of say algorithmic cognitive
1:04:59
processing. you know, something will occur to you rather than having you think it up. And if you're creative,
1:05:05
something distant occurs, right? And so spontaneous vocation with regards to
1:05:11
shamanism, more creative people, the more creative people are likely to be more dynamic in their personality
1:05:18
transformations. So a conservative person low in openness is likely to find
1:05:24
a pathway and bloody well stick to it. And that's a good idea. If you're not very smart and if times are uncertain
1:05:30
and if everybody knows what's going on and the pathway has been well specified,
1:05:35
stay the hell on it. But in times of change, right, or if you're trying to gain an edge, a creative approach is
1:05:42
useful. High risk but high return, right? And so whereas the conservative
1:05:50
approach is low risk and moderate return and characterized by a relative lack of
1:05:55
entropy. Now I suspect as well that the shamanic types are not only high in
1:06:01
trait openness which makes them dynamic and flexible in their personality restructuring but also high in trait
1:06:07
neuroticism. 

# Creativity Output - The Pareto Principle
Creative output follows a distribution pattern called the Pareto principle where a small number of people generate the majority of the output.  In creative work this means fewer individuals produce most of the ideas while the majority contribute less.

# Price's Law - Creative Distribution - Square root of total participants produces half of creative work in any enterprise revealing natural productivity patterns.

How many words you produce in 3 minutes is a decent predictor of your lifetime creativity. So especially in combination
with general cognitive ability or intelligence. Intelligence is probably something like the rate at which you can
produce ideas. Whereas creativity is something like the breadth of idiational
scope and the probability that relatively distant ideas will be
