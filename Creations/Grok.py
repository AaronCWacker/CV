Verse 1:
From the Command Bridge we rise and soar
Through crystal windows to distant shores
In the Great Hangar ships dance and sway
While Living Gardens light our way
Chorus:
We're sailing through the stars tonight
Twenty chambers burning bright
Each window shows a different view
Of everything we're passing through
Verse 2:
Healing Sanctuary mends our souls
While in the Commons our stories grow
The Dreamforge spins illusions rare
Strategic Command plots our flair
In the Observatory, time stands still
As Gravity Well bends at will
Bridge:
The Gathering Place where memories flow
Past sleeping dreamers down below
In the Power Heart our future gleams
Through Machine Shrine's electric dreams
Verse 3:
Long Sleep Hall keeps our people safe
While Gravity Dance twirls through space
On Memory Beach we find our home
Beneath Knowledge Vault's stellar dome
The Growth Chamber feeds our wandering hearts
As Star Court guides our brand new start
Extended Chorus:
Twenty rooms of steel and light
Each one reaching cosmic height
Cathedral ceilings touch the stars
Making near what once was far
Windows show the endless night
As we make our stellar flight
Final Verse:
From deck to deck and door to door
Each chamber holds what we're living for
The stories of our species' flight
Through darkness into endless light
Till we find our brave new home
No longer bound, no longer roam
Outro:
Command Bridge calls, it's time to fly
Through starlit chambers, you and I
In cathedral halls our dreams take flight

Now revenge is all I dream

Ice in my veins, my vengeance is due
When hellfire meets my frozen rage

Of how you stole that win from me
In my fortress made of frost
Planning to reclaim what's lost

When hellfire meets my frozen rage

– Show Summary
In workshops where the thinking never ceases,
New machinery hums with strange creation,
While we who built them marvel at their pieces—
Each spark of art beyond our expectation.
Yet in this age of digital persuasion,
One thing remains our deepest obligation:
We are the ones who cherish our duration,
Who care if mankind finds its destination.
The tasks we've done since childhood's education
Now fall to minds of silicon foundation,
But partnership requires demonstration—
Bring value, or face isolation.
Empathy's not sentiment's relation,
But sight through others' windows of sensation,
The sharpest tool for problem's exploration,
Language the key to every conversation.
