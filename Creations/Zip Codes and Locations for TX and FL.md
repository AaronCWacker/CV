The United States uses 3-digit ZIP code prefixes (also known as Sectional Center Facility or SCF codes) to designate major postal processing regions within a state. For Texas, these prefixes cover all ZIP codes starting with 7 (except 71, 71x, 73x except 733, and 74x except 750-754), plus 88x for the El Paso area. The complete list of active 3-digit prefixes for TX, based on USPS data, is as follows (sorted numerically):

Population Estimates by 3-Digit ZIP Code Prefix
Population data is typically reported at the 5-digit ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) level by the U.S. Census Bureau, not aggregated by 3-digit prefix. To provide estimates for each prefix, I aggregated the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates (2019-2023) for all ZCTAs sharing that prefix. These are approximate, as ZCTAs approximate but do not exactly match postal ZIP codes, and some small or unpopulated ZCTAs may be excluded. The total across all prefixes is approximately 29.1 million (close to Texas's estimated 30.5 million in 2023, with differences due to ACS methodology and group quarters).
