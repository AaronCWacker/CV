# Mnemonics and the pegword system of memory can make your memory photographic and superhero performant.

## Here is how:

1. I would like to generate a set of Image Generation prompts which create ideal images for my Mnemonic system.
2. Shown below it uses image words as a pegword mnemonic to master episodic and semantic memories and memorize an amazing amount of knowledge.
3. The techniques are using mirroring patterns, mental model building and grokking for the gold, speed reading with multimodal models to help distill knowledge graphs into easily remembering sequences.   

Here are the ones 1-9.  Also my 10-20 list includes: 10. Toes, 11. Drumsticks, 12. Two Boxing Gloves for 1-2 punch, 13. Hockey Mask (Jason from friday 13th) horror, 14. Fort Worth - the Texas location, 15. Adam my friend with Rube Goldman Machine Mousetrap when I was 15 years old, 16. Cake with Sixteen Candles with music notes with Molly Ringwald, 17. Rain Man Dustin Hoffman who had amazing intellectual skills dressed in Suit together with Tom Cruise, 18. Soldier at 18 years old as adult, 19. Prince and the Revolution singing 1999, from a black Jaguar 1999 XK Convertible Black on black chrome wheels, and 20. A twenty dollar bill.  The 1..10 series is here.  For each number I want an Emoji set with short description of my mnemonic image generation prompts as a markdown outline with emojis..  🖼 Picture Mnemonic Outline
🗼 Lighthouse - Represents #1, a beacon of guidance.
👓 Eyeglasses - Symbolizes #2, two lenses for clarity.
🪑 Stool - Denotes #3, three legs for stability.
