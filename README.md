20230309	9	New Skills or Technology	Strongly Agree	Aaron packed into 1 hour an entire day's worth of amazing and practical content for me to watch again -- at a much slower pace so I can absorb and learn and practice. THANK YOU!
20230309	9	New Skills or Technology	Agree	
20230309	9	New Skills or Technology, Recommended by Co-Worker	Agree	
20230309	10	New Skills or Technology	Strongly Agree	really well explained session ! Would love to attend and explore more classes by Aaron !
20230309	10	New Skills or Technology	Agree	It appears it met the objective, but the class moved so fast I was unable to keep up with watching and doing at the same time so learning and copying/pasting examples run was not possible for me. I look forward to going through the video and watching more intently and following the examples to learn more. It appears to be thorough and something I will definitely be able to use.
20230302	10	New Skills or Technology	Strongly Agree	Like to participate and contribute to UHG AI platform models and learn more
20230302	10	New Skills or Technology, Recommended/Required by Manager	Agree	Although the main goal was to show how easy and fast it is to build AI apps, there were many dependencies and technical skills referenced and/or required for deeper knowledge (ChatGPT prompts, Python, GitHub, Streamlit, MarkDown). With inspired passion, I'll now go learn and practice those skills so I can apply them to building new apps with HuggingFace. I needed to watch the replay with frequent pauses, to allow it all to sink in.
