As an **AI teacher** on a weekly basis with AI Zero to Hero lecture course and annual global Hackathon leader, I helped train over 2300 engineers per year running Optum's Global Hackathon since 2019 with also over 400 engineers per year attending my weekly AI Zero to Hero class through **Optum Technology University**, while maintaining a near perfect **Net Promoter Score of 97.7% promoters**.  

My own growth in AI development productivity has increased from up to ten programs per year (2021), to 200 per year in 2022, and over 578 total within Q1 2023 showing **over 100x** increase in productivity by using and teaching AI pair programming and learning techniques.  

AI/ML platform technologies I am familiar with include Huggingface, Transformers, Keras, Jupyter, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, Fast.ai, GPT-3, DataRobot, Azure, Torch, Tensorflow, Streamlit, Gradio, Docker, Terraform, Python, Github and VSCode.

With product engineering and delivery I have led delivery of at least three large AI oriented projects per year since 2018 including notable successes such as 12 IP disclosure submissions with one successful patent covering 32 features for automating prior auth determinations using decision trees and AI, also serving as a patent mentor.  **Patent Link**: https://assignment.uspto.gov/patent/index.html#/patent/search/resultAssignment?id=51748-479

11. 20230309	9	New Skills or Technology	Strongly Agree	Aaron packed into 1 hour an entire day's worth of amazing and practical content for me to watch again -- at a much slower pace so I can absorb and learn and practice. THANK YOU!
12. 20230309	9	New Skills or Technology	Agree	
13. 20230309	9	New Skills or Technology, Recommended by Co-Worker	Agree	
14. 20230309	10	New Skills or Technology	Strongly Agree	really well explained session ! Would love to attend and explore more classes by Aaron !
15. 20230309	10	New Skills or Technology	Agree	It appears it met the objective, but the class moved so fast I was unable to keep up with watching and doing at the same time so learning and copying/pasting examples run was not possible for me. I look forward to going through the video and watching more intently and following the examples to learn more. It appears to be thorough and something I will definitely be able to use.
16. 20230302	10	New Skills or Technology	Strongly Agree	Like to participate and contribute to UHG AI platform models and learn more
17. 20230302	10	New Skills or Technology, Recommended/Required by Manager	Agree	Although the main goal was to show how easy and fast it is to build AI apps, there were many dependencies and technical skills referenced and/or required for deeper knowledge (ChatGPT prompts, Python, GitHub, Streamlit, MarkDown). With inspired passion, I'll now go learn and practice those skills so I can apply them to building new apps with HuggingFace. I needed to watch the replay with frequent pauses, to allow it all to sink in. 
18. 20230302	10	New Skills or Technology	Strongly Agree	Thank you, Aaron, for the great session.  Aaron was very detailed and clear while presenting the information.
