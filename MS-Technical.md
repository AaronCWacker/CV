It’s also inclusive: we aim to make AI accessible to all — consumers, businesses, developers — so that everyone can realize its benefits.

Microsoft AI (MAI) is seeking an experienced Backend Engineer to help build Copilot memory and personalization — AI that remembers, evolves, and grows with each user. You’ll work in a highly collaborative, fast-paced environment to develop systems that deepen memory with every interaction, personalize experiences to reflect each user’s unique style and goals, and make interactions feel more like working with a trusted partner than using a tool.

Responsibilities

Design and build large-scale Copilot memory and personalization systems leveraging search, embeddings, retrieval, ranking, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
Apply subject-matter expertise in cross-product features, collaborating with appropriate stakeholders to drive project plans, release plans, and deliverables across multiple groups.
Hold accountability as a Designated Responsible Individual (DRI), mentoring engineers across products/solutions, working on-call to monitor system/product/service for degradation, downtime, or interruptions.
Proactively seek out new knowledge and adapt to new trends, technical solutions, and patterns that improve the availability, reliability, efficiency, observability, and performance of products while also driving consistency in monitoring and operations at scale and share knowledge with other engineers.
Enjoy working in a fast-paced, design-driven, product development cycle.
Navigate ambiguity and clear roadblocks to deliver solutions quickly and iteratively, ensuring they reach users effectively.
