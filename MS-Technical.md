# Structured Knowledge Graphs to Distill 1. What They are Looking for,  2. Skills, 3. Responsibilities, 4. Qualifications

## Gemini vs Grok vs GPT vs Claude

1. After pasting 4k+ lines for all four:
2. Gemini 2.5 Pro finished first.  Fairly short output.
3. Grok is running and continues - most detailed output
4. GPT is non starter - could not accept 4k+ lines as input.
5. Claude completed.

# Standing on first take:
1. X Grok continues and is on 46+ and is curating the information procedurally without impediment.
2. Google Gemini has the best structured outline.  Perhaps too short?  We will check.
3. Anthropic Claude Completed - frequently I choose Gemini or Grok over Claude because of the token limitation it usually reaches so this is a detriment to large programs with many iterations since you eventually cannot continue.
4. GPT not having a wide context window for Input is a fail out of the gate.  It could easily accept input then RAG it to offset problem of non-fit.  This will have to change sometime since it puts GPT last for really large content input problems which should be expected not disallowed.


# Comparitive Postings:  Our pursuit here is to learn what in demand requirements we have and how to test for them and score near perfect on generated assessment test questions including descending order rank questions on best things to know and check regarding AI development of SOTA technology.

# GPT Did not Finish!!

Since this is most disappointing I decide to try breaking GPT's into two.  Maybe it can do half?

Nope not even half works.  GPT simply has too small of an input context window which will be problematic.  Claudde does however show that its input is 359.29 KB •8,385 lines  This in itself is useful.

Overview
If you’ve ever watched a massive data pipeline process billions of records without breaking a sweat, felt genuine satisfaction debugging a business critical schema migration, or gotten excited about shaving milliseconds off pipeline latency then you’re in the right spot. We’re looking for the best data engineers. Data engineers who have built and scaled data systems that others depend on, who take pride in delivering rock-solid data quality, and who genuinely enjoy the craft of data engineering. If you’re the type of person who celebrates when your monitoring dashboards show all green and gets energized by the challenge of making data flow seamlessly across complex systems, this role is for you. 

Join us to architect and implement the data backbone that powers Copilot for millions of users worldwide. You’ll own the full data lifecycle – from building lightning-fast ETL pipelines that handle massive scale to crafting experimentation frameworks that drive product decisions. We need someone who thrives on solving complex data challenges, loves collaborating with brilliant teammates, and gets genuinely excited about building infrastructure that just works. In our fast-paced environment, you’ll have the freedom to innovate and the support to build world-class data products that make a real impact. 

By applying to this position, you are required to be local to the San Francisco area or Redmond area and in office 3 days a week.
