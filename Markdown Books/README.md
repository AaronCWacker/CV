"True intelligence begins at the border of one's neighbor; in the simple 'bubble' of a local exchange, we find the heartbeat of morphogenesis. When elements possess the competency to choose their direction, sorting is no longer a command, but a collective migration—where order emerges from the clustering of kindred values, proving that even the smallest parts know where they belong."
--Aaron Christopher Wacker
