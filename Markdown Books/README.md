"True intelligence begins at the border of one's neighbor; in the simple 'bubble' of a local exchange, we find the heartbeat of morphogenesis. When elements possess the competency to choose their direction, sorting is no longer a command, but a collective migration—where order emerges from the clustering of kindred values, proving that even the smallest parts know where they belong."
--Aaron Christopher Wacker


# Clustering

## Why Clustering is the Heart of the Model
1. Sort demonstrates that local rules create global clusters. This mirrors how biological tissues differentiate:
2. Boundary Sensing: Just as cells detect chemical gradients, the "bubble" mechanism senses numerical gradients.
3. Kin Recognition: Elements move past "strangers" (higher/lower values) until they find their place among "peers," leading to the spontaneous clustering of sorted domains.
4. Minimal Agency: You are arguing that the array isn't just a list—it's a field of agents using local competency to reach a global homeostatic state (the sorted list).
