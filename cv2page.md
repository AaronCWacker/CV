1. The outline should be valid markdown and every line needs to start with an emoji in the outline.  2. For sub numbering start at 1 everytime.  Dont do multipart naming - instead just use branches and consistent emojis for skill groups.  3. In mermaid model the () paranethesis characters are not allowed so it errors.  Make sure labels dont have non ascii letter characters yet have the best representative emoji at the front so easily to sight read fast.  4.  For the mermaid graph I expect that to be multi model, multi graph.  Maybe make one per branch and show each one with seperate mermaid blocks of markdown that begin with code block markers ```mermaid to start and ``` to stop on lines of their own.   Shown full code listing and include as code inside app.py of python streamlit app.py  5. Create a requirements.txt for every python library related to the skills even individual ones.  also use Usage comments like example I show below.     Make sure to add any python library for any skill mentioning a tool or technology which has one or more python libraries, and also sort them in requirements.txt   Here is a sample:  # requirements.txt

## **Senior Principal Engineer** 
Over **30 years** experience leading architecture and development teams focusing on AI delivery last 5 years delivering AI Assessment, Care Plan, Triage, Behavioral Health, Medical Inpatient, Outpatient, SNF provider recommendation systems for Clinical business and technology.  I am a technical leader for two production products in Optum Health for **Triage** and **Patient Check In** EMR integrated health care processes used in U.S. care delivery organizations (CDOs).  

Nearly every review since 2010, I have scored **5/5 exceeding expectations** for review scores.

As an **AI teacher** on a weekly basis with my AI Zero to Hero course and annual global Hackathon leader, I have helped train over 3000 engineers on using AI for health care.  I've also run Optum's Global Hackathon since 2019-2022 with over 2500 engineers.  My weekly AI Zero to Hero class through **Optum Technology University** taught Generative AI, Streamlit, Python, Gradio, Huggingface Model, Dataset, and Space development.  As a teacher I've achieved a **Net Promoter Score of 97.7% promoters** by helping others learn to build AI apps quickly and comprehensively using the latest AI techniques.

My own growth in AI development productivity has increased from up to ten programs per year (2021), to 200 per year in 2022, and over 578 total within Q1 2023 showing **over 100x** increase in productivity by using and teaching AI pair programming and learning techniques.  

AI/ML platform technologies I am familiar with include Huggingface, Transformers, Keras, Jupyter, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, Fast.ai, GPT-3, DataRobot, Azure, Torch, Tensorflow, Streamlit, Gradio, Docker, Terraform, Python, Github and VSCode.

With product engineering and delivery I have led delivery of at least three large AI oriented projects per year since 2018 including notable successes such as 12 IP disclosure submissions with one successful patent covering 32 features for automating prior auth determinations using decision trees and AI, also serving as a patent mentor.  **Patent Link**: https://assignment.uspto.gov/patent/index.html#/patent/search/resultAssignment?id=51748-479

15. 20230309	10	New Skills or Technology	Agree	It appears it met the objective, but the class moved so fast I was unable to keep up with watching and doing at the same time so learning and copying/pasting examples run was not possible for me. I look forward to going through the video and watching more intently and following the examples to learn more. It appears to be thorough and something I will definitely be able to use.

17. 20230302	10	New Skills or Technology, Recommended/Required by Manager	Agree	Although the main goal was to show how easy and fast it is to build AI apps, there were many dependencies and technical skills referenced and/or required for deeper knowledge (ChatGPT prompts, Python, GitHub, Streamlit, MarkDown). With inspired passion, I'll now go learn and practice those skills so I can apply them to building new apps with HuggingFace. I needed to watch the replay with frequent pauses, to allow it all to sink in.
