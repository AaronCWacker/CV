I am a technical leader for two production products in Optum Health for **Triage** and **Patient Check In** EMR integrated health care processes used in U.S. care delivery organizations (CDOs).  

Nearly every review since 2010, I have scored **5/5 exceeding expectations** for review scores.

As an **AI teacher** on a weekly basis with my AI Zero to Hero course and annual global Hackathon leader, I have helped train over 3000 engineers on using AI for health care.  I've also run Optum's Global Hackathon since 2019-2022 with over 2500 engineers.  My weekly AI Zero to Hero class through **Optum Technology University** taught Generative AI, Streamlit, Python, Gradio, Huggingface Model, Dataset, and Space development.  As a teacher I've achieved a **Net Promoter Score of 97.7% promoters** by helping others learn to build AI apps quickly and comprehensively using the latest AI techniques.

My own growth in AI development productivity has increased from up to ten programs per year (2021), to 200 per year in 2022, and over 578 total within Q1 2023 showing **over 100x** increase in productivity by using and teaching AI pair programming and learning techniques.  

AI/ML platform technologies I am familiar with include Huggingface, Transformers, Keras, Jupyter, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, Fast.ai, GPT-3, DataRobot, Azure, Torch, Tensorflow, Streamlit, Gradio, Docker, Terraform, Python, Github and VSCode.

With product engineering and delivery I have led delivery of at least three large AI oriented projects per year since 2018 including notable successes such as 12 IP disclosure submissions with one successful patent covering 32 features for automating prior auth determinations using decision trees and AI, also serving as a patent mentor.  **Patent Link**: https://assignment.uspto.gov/patent/index.html#/patent/search/resultAssignment?id=51748-479

   2. Playing a larger role in driving initiatives in AI across our division using Data Science, Engineering and AI at scale.  I feel I have this aligned through partnership with others with our AI platform where I work with partner division teams.
      - This would involve driving product evolution for our 8 AI based apps and implementing them across our existing product markets to share in value.  Some groundwork is laid but I want to learn more on gaining cross department leadership buy in.
      - Appealing to potential customers interested in joint ownership of applying what we accomplished across divisions.
   3. Understanding how to appeal to leadership vision at VP/C level leadership level.  Working through MLRB and RUAI on further work and deeper understanding of how to craft and live up to value statements, CBA's and cost optimization through AI CI/CD automation and performance measurement.  
      - Insight on how to present and tell clear quality and efficiency stories with strong CBA's.

11. 20230309	9	New Skills or Technology	Strongly Agree	Aaron packed into 1 hour an entire day's worth of amazing and practical content for me to watch again -- at a much slower pace so I can absorb and learn and practice. THANK YOU!
12. 20230309	9	New Skills or Technology	Agree	
13. 20230309	9	New Skills or Technology, Recommended by Co-Worker	Agree	
14. 20230309	10	New Skills or Technology	Strongly Agree	really well explained session ! Would love to attend and explore more classes by Aaron !
15. 20230309	10	New Skills or Technology	Agree	It appears it met the objective, but the class moved so fast I was unable to keep up with watching and doing at the same time so learning and copying/pasting examples run was not possible for me. I look forward to going through the video and watching more intently and following the examples to learn more. It appears to be thorough and something I will definitely be able to use.
16. 20230302	10	New Skills or Technology	Strongly Agree	Like to participate and contribute to UHG AI platform models and learn more
17. 20230302	10	New Skills or Technology, Recommended/Required by Manager	Agree	Although the main goal was to show how easy and fast it is to build AI apps, there were many dependencies and technical skills referenced and/or required for deeper knowledge (ChatGPT prompts, Python, GitHub, Streamlit, MarkDown). With inspired passion, I'll now go learn and practice those skills so I can apply them to building new apps with HuggingFace. I needed to watch the replay with frequent pauses, to allow it all to sink in. 
18. 20230302	10	New Skills or Technology	Strongly Agree	Thank you, Aaron, for the great session.  Aaron was very detailed and clear while presenting the information.
